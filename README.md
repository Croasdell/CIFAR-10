# CIFAR-10 Image Classifier

CIFAR-10 (short for *Canadian Institute For Advanced Research*) is a [famous dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIFAR-10) consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes (cat, dog, car, etc.) with 6,000 images per class. In this tutorial, we'll use the CIFAR-10 dataset to train a multi layer neural network to recognize images. Then we'll cross validate the model to see how well it performs.

- **Difficulty**: Hard
- **Training time**: Long
- **Memory needed**: > 8G
